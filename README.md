Here's a little about me! 

- ðŸ”­ I'm a Data Engineer with Ba. Physics, Ba. Mathematics, a Graduate Certificate in research (computational neuroscience). I'm working now in a Medical/Health Tech Startup based in Brisbane, Autralia called WearOptimo. 
- ðŸŒ± The majority of my programming experience is in R MATLAB, and python, though am also comfortable with bash shell, and various typesetting languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ In my spare time, I like to make art. The majoirty of my work is geometric, with a lot of dot work for the shading. I have hosted one small exhibition and you can check out my art at `@_lameystringerdraws` on instagram.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R, shiny apps, anomalous diffusion, all things data (management, architecture and manipulation) and did I mention shiny apps?
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
