### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--**AmyStringer/AmyStringer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Here's a little about me! 

- ðŸ”­ The majority of my programming experience is in R and MATLAB. I've had vaious roles using R, and use MATLAB for my master's research. 
- ðŸŒ± Much of my work experience is in the broad area of "data science" in a range of different research areas. My masters research direction is in computational neuroscience and applying fractional calculus models to MRI images in an attempt to draw out details on brian microstructure.  
- ðŸ‘¯ In my spare time, I like to make art. The majoirty of my work is geometric, with a lot of dot work for the shading. I recently hosted an exhibition and you can check out my art at `@_lameystringerdraws` on instagram 
- ðŸ¤” I'm currently on the lookout for more opportunities to enhance my programming skills in R and MATLAB (and python would be a bonus!) in a way that links my previous work experience with data and my masters research area of neuroscience.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R, shiny apps, anomalous diffusion, fractional calculus, and did I mention shiny apps? 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me by email at aj.stringer@qut.edu.au
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to bind books and now I try to make my own notebooks and journals!
