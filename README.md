### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--**AmyStringer/AmyStringer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Here's a little about me! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few different projects. I'm working as a research assistant for both the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematics and Statistics (ACEMS) and for the School of Mathematical Sciences at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) on statistics and shiny app heavy projects, while also studying my MPhil in computational mathematics applied to MRI images of the brain. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a curriculum for training courses in using remote sensing for agricultural monitoring, and also how to use weather data in predictions for plant growth. In my masters, I'm learning about fractional calculus and anomalous diffusion in the brain. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on shiny apps! I LOVE making shiny apps, so much so that I now do it for fun.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding open source versions of matlab functions/capabilities 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R, shiny apps, MATLAB (gasp!), anomalous diffusion, fractional calculus, crop monitoring, and did I mention shiny apps? 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach my by email at aj.stringer@qut.edu.au
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am an advocate for better mental health in general, and opening up conversations about these difficult topics. I've had quite a unique mental health journey and I've written about it in a blog. If you'd like to read about my experiences and how I've coped with them and the experiences of some of friends and colleagues see [Lamey, Ed, Pete and Po](https://thelameystringer.com/).
