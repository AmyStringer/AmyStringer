### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--**AmyStringer/AmyStringer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Here's a little about me! 

- ðŸ”­ I moved from a small town to a capital city convinced I would come out the other end of uni as an engineer. But when I got here I realised there were so many other interesting things! 1 Ba. Physics, 1 Ba. Mathematics, 75% of a masters degree, and 2 "fluent" programming languages later and I still want to do everything when I "grow up".  
- ðŸŒ± The majority of my programming experience is in R and MATLAB. I've had various roles using R, and use MATLAB for my master's research. I generally work under the broad umbrella of "data science" in a range of different research areas., and my masters research direction is then in the area of computational neuroscience. 
- ðŸ‘¯ In my spare time, I like to make art. The majoirty of my work is geometric, with a lot of dot work for the shading. I recently hosted an exhibition and you can check out my art at `@_lameystringerdraws` on instagram 
- ðŸ¤” I'm currently on the lookout for more opportunities to enhance my programming skills in R and MATLAB (and python would be a bonus!) in a way that links my previous work experience with data and my masters research area of neuroscience.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R, shiny apps, anomalous diffusion, fractional calculus, and did I mention shiny apps? 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me by email at aj.stringer@qut.edu.au
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to bind books and now I try to make my own notebooks and journals!
