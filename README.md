### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--**AmyStringer/AmyStringer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Here's a little about me! 

- ðŸ”­ I moved from a small town to a capital city convinced I would come out the other end of uni as an engineer. But when I got here I realised there were so many other interesting things! 1 Ba. Physics, 1 Ba. Mathematics, Graduate Certificate in research, with a neuroscience topic, and 3 fluent-ish programming languages later and I still want to do everything when I "grow up". 
- ðŸŒ± The majority of my programming experience is in R and MATLAB, and now python. I would say I am more comfortable now in python than in MATLAB, despite my studies being very MATLAB focussed. I've worked various roles using R for statistical analyses, production of educational materials and web app development but now work as a data scientist for a medical tech start up in Brisbane, WearOptimo, working predominantly with python.
- ðŸ‘¯ In my spare time, I like to make art. The majoirty of my work is geometric, with a lot of dot work for the shading. I have hosted one small exhibition and you can check out my art at `@_lameystringerdraws` on instagram.
- ðŸ¤” I have dabbled in roles/post graduate study in the area of computational neuroscience, and I continue to strive towards this field in future. There's something about the brain... 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R, shiny apps, anomalous diffusion, fractional calculus, data management and manipulation and did I mention shiny apps?
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to bind books and now I try to make my own notebooks and journals!
